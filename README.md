This is a self-made ReactJS project that works with a back-end system with ExpressJS and MongoDB.
It is intended to be a trading website where people can post offers and other people can browse and interact with them.

It is intended mostly for me to practise my backend skills along with frontend, as well as something i can use to show i have experience working with these technologies.

It features a selfmade backend which i use to handle the server side, and supports the following operations:

    1. CRUD operations
    2. Login / register functionality
    3. Saves all content(users , offers) on a database(MongoDB)
    4. Has Route guards


How to use:

1. Open a terminal in backend and run npm start
2. Open a terminal in SRC and run npm start

Work in progress:
    
    1. Updating the visuals of profile
    2. Adding delete and edit functionality for creators
    3. Possibly updating the forms visuals
