This is a self-made ReactJS project that works with a back-end system with ExpressJS and MongoDB.


It is intended mostly for me to practise my backend skills along with frontend, as well as something i can use to show i have experience working with these technologies.

It features a selfmade backend which i use to handle the server side, and supports the following operations:

    1. CRUD operations
    2. Login / register functionality
    3. Saves all content(users , offers) on a database(MongoDB)
    4. Has Route guards
